## Background

Description of what you were asked to do. Try to be as detailed as possible.
The idea is to give enough background to the reviewer to perform the code review.
Include relevant links to Jira, Confluence, and other sources.

## Changes

High-level description of what changes you introduced in this PR. Don't bother going into details as they can be seen in the code but also avoid comments like "changed X file" since it's obvious from the diff.

## Extra

[REMOVE this block when not necessary]
Design decisions, diagrams, pictures, results, outstanding work.

## Checklist

- [ ] I updated the tests, if necessary
